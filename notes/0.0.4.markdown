Release 0.0.4:

* Added **sbt-netbeans-processor**;
* Simplified package structure - **sbt-netbeans-plugin** sources were moved to `netbeans.plugin`;

## Using the processor
Add the processor's repository:

        > *nbrepo at http://remeniuk.github.com/maven/

Add **sbt-netbeans-processor**:

        > *netbeans is org.netbeans.plugin sbt-netbeans-processor 0.0.4

Create an empty SBT-Netbeans project with just one command (plugins and project definitions will be created for you, and **sbt-netbeans-plugin** will be downloaded and wired automatically):

        > netbeans create default

To get the list of all supported project templates, submit the following command:

       > netbeans create
       [error] Invalid arg string! Use one of the following:
       [error] create default | web | plugin | processor

Processors are added per SBT-user, so once you install **sbt-netbeans-processor**, it will always require just one SBT command to "netbeanize" the project (without a need to manually create or copy any files).
In order to remove or update **sbt-netbeans-processor**, use the following command:

      *remove netbeans
