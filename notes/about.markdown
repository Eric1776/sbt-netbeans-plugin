[sbt-netbeans-plugin](https://github.com/remeniuk/sbt-netbeans-plugin) enhances SBT project layout with the scripts, folders, configs and property files required by Netbeans. Netbeans configs hereafter are merged with the SBT project properties, setting valid compile/test classpaths (and other properties), which enables correct displaying of the project structure (including dependent projects), highlighting and code-completion in the IDE.
